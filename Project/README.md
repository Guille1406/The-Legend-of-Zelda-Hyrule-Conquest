 # DESCRIPTION
 In The Legend Of Zelda: Hyrule Conquest, you must join your partner in a unique adventure in which your synergy when fighting and solving puzzles will make you emerge victorious from each room full of enemies and enigmas.

Link and Zelda will join forces in this multiplayer adventure, completing puzzles for two players and fighting against different enemies. To overcome it you will have available unique weapons for each player being Link a melee character and Zelda a ranged character.

Uniting their forces they will be able to advance through the enemy forces and solve mysteries that allow them to be able to defeat the army that tries to invade hyrule.

The first act focuses on the culverts of the Castle of Hyrule, where they must get victorious to be able to advance to the dungeon.

In the dungeon, you will find even more complicated enemies and a very powerful enemy that will make things difficult for our heroes.
